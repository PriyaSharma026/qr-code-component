## Overview

This is my first project on frontend Mentor. It was based on HTML and CSS and this project was very helpful to practice my coding skills.

Above is the screenshot of my project.


## My process
Here is the approach I followed to build this project :
- Firstly, I created a folder on github (a platform to launch/share your projects online) then cloned that folder in local space and opened the folder in VS code(IDE to write code).
- Then, I went through learning the needs of the projects.
- After that I started writing code in html file to build the structure first.
- After building the structure, I started designing the website using CSS.
- I tried to make website responsive without using media queries.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

First thing I learnt because of this project was setting up git and github.
During the project I learnt about how file paths work and how you should write file paths according to their location.

This is where I used the file path to bring image from images folder to css folder

```css
.qr-code-img-container {
  background-image: url("../images/qr-code-img.png");
}
```
